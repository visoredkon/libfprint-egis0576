 * All packets work like this:
 * E     G     I     S
 * 0x45, 0x47, 0x49, 0x53, [CMD], [REG], [VALUE(s)]
 *
 * [CMD] = Command
 * [REG] = Register
 * [VALUE(s)] = Values to write or read
 * [CMD] seem to be:
 * 0x60: Read [REG]
 * - [VALUE] is set to 0x00? Not sure, 0575 pkts sometimes had a value but 0x00
 * seems to work
 *
 * 0x61: Write [VALUE] into [REG]
 * - [VALUE] is the single byte to write
 *
 * 0x62: Read starting from [REG] (burst read)
 * - [VALUE] is the amount of bytes to read
 *
 * 0x63: Write starting from [REG] (burst read)
 * - [VALUE] consists of: [AMOUNT OF BYTES TO WRITE], [BYTES TO WRITE]
 * - example: "0x63, 0x01, 0x02, 0x0f, 0x03"
 *   -> 0x63 [CMD]; 0x01 [REG]; 0x02 [two bytes]; 0x0f, 0x03 [bytes]
 *
 * 0x64: Seems to be the command that fetches image data
 * - no separate [REG] or [VALUE]
 * - it is just the image size (width * size), in our case 70 * 57 = 3990
 * (0x0f96)
 *   -> So the command is "0x64, 0x0f, 0x96"
 *
 * Responses always (except the image response) echo back:
 * S     I     G     E
 * 0x53, 0x49, 0x47, 0x45, ...[CMD], [REG], [VALUE(s)] ?

 * Huge credit goes to Animeshz's efforts on github
 * (https://github.com/Animeshz/EgisTec-EH575)
 * and on libfprint
 * (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/-/merge_requests/317) as
 * those laid the base for this effort.
 *
 * Initial tests proved that the EH0575 and the EH0576 seem to work basically
 * the same as by just providing the EH0575 packets I was able to occasionally
 * get little data out of mine.
 *
 * I was unable to get the fingerprint reader to work in a VM (both Win10 and
 * Win11) and Wireshark USBcap does not allow to be run on Windows-To-Go so I
 * could not use any USB captures from Windows.
 *
 * Therefore, the rest of the reverse engineering was solely done with static
 * analysis in Ghidra of the EgisTouchFP0576.dll UMDF driver provided
 * by Lenovo
 * (https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/de/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/flex-series/flex-5-14alc7).
 * I am no professional "hacker" by any means so I cannot guarantee that these
 * are 100% correct but they work :D

/*
 * According to static analysis the driver polls using this packet a max. amount
 * of EGIS0576_POLL_COUNT before requesting the image.
 * Translated to this driver it checks the following condition in order to
 * proceed to requesting the image:
 *
 * (response_buffer[6] & 0x01) == 0x01
 *
 * Based on observation this has been always true for already the first request
 * so it essentially runs once.
